# iMedBox---HIS

IEEE Xplore : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10200103

An intelligent home-based platform, the iHome Health-IoT, is proposed and implemented.
The platform involves an open-platform-based intelligent medicine box (iMedBox) with enhanced 
connectivity and interchangeability for the integration of devices and services.
The proposed platform seamlessly fuses IoT devices (e.g., wearable sensors and intelligent medicine packages) with in-home healthcare services for an improved user experience and service efficiency.
iMedBox serves as a home healthcare station providing strong interoperability and IoT network 
connectivity.

Trend in healthcare is to move routine medical checks and other healthcare services from Hospital Centric to the Home-Centric.
Real-time monitoring and analyzing vital signs to early-detect or predict life-threatening adverse events.
Checking whether they are following their prescribed treatment, including taking their prescribed medicine on time.
